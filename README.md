## ‚ú®Overview

The search.py module is a Python framework designed to help solve search problems using classic search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). The module provides two main abstract classes: SearchProblem and Node, which users can extend to create their own search implementations.

This module is particularly useful for anyone working with problem-solving techniques involving state-space search, such as pathfinding, game solving, or any domain that requires intelligent exploration of states.


## Key Features

- Abstract Classes for Custom Problems: SearchProblem and Node provide a structured way to define custom search problems by overriding their abstract methods.

- Built-In Support for BFS and DFS: The solve() method supports both BFS and DFS, with flexible components like QueueFrontier and StackFrontier for implementing different search strategies.

- Detailed Logging: The module logs the search progress, showing the state of the frontier, the explored nodes, and expanded nodes at each step, enabling users to analyze the search behavior thoroughly.



## üì• Installation
No installation required; simply clone the repository and import search.py into your Python project.


```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jjavrui/search-module.git
cd my_module
```

Or add search.py to your project folder and import it.
```bash
from search import SearchProblem, Node
```


## üöÄ Basic usage
Example of using 'searc' for maze solving script:

Once abstract methods of derived classes (Maze and MazeNode) are defined, maze solving is just calling **solve()** on MazeNode object.
Show result with **show_solution()** method, and get a detailed log of algorithm steps for that maze calling **save_algorithm_steps_to_file()**.

    from search import Node, SearchProblem

    class Maze(SearchProblem):
         def __init__():
            # Maze specific implementation here

         def show_solution():
            # Maze specific implementation here

    class MazeNode(Node)
         def __init__():
            # Maze specific implementation here

         def actions():
            # Maze specific implementation here

         def result():
            # Maze specific implementation here


    maze = Maze(<filename>)
    maze.solve('BFS')
    maze.show_solution(dynamic=False)
    maze.save_algorithm_steps_to_file()
